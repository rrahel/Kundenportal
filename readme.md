# Kunden Portal
This application is a portal for customers to get a better overview of all the bills and contracts in relationship to a company.
The company manager can create account for the clients and continuously upload:
	bills that the clients have paid or have to pay, 
	all the contracts that the client has with the company, 
	broadcast an information to all the clients, 
	all the provisions that the partners have and 
	all of the service and hosting offers that the company offer.
A partner, that has connections with a client that needs one or more of the company services, can use this app to choose all the 
required hosting and service offers for the client and generate a PDF as a bill with all the necessary information. 
The company manager gets notified via E-mail for every bill that the partners have generated and for every change that the client
make on their profile information.
The client is notified via E-mail whenever a new bill is uploaded in the portal.

To run the application copy the project on the public folder of the web server and create a Database by importing the /database/DB_import.sql file.
